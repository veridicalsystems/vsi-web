<h3>
Overview
</h3>
Internet access in this area has been a challenge, to put it mildly<small><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></small>.
Our best, and in fact only, viable option for Internet access seems to be from WISPs (Wireless Internet Service
Providers).
<p>Many of us obtain Internet access from a small local WISP<small><sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></small> that I
will refer to as the "incumbent WISP". However, for reasons
that need not be belabored here that has been less than satisfactory for many of us.
<p>
This web page discusses a new possibility.
<h3>
The SOHO leased line (T-1)
</h3>
I work at home with a bunch of computers, in what is a fairly typical Small Office Home Office (SOHO) configuration
with all the computing services of a small to medium size commercial office (hosting web, E-mail, telephony services in addition to more
specialized networking services).
For the past five years or so I've been leasing a T-1 line. It's slow (~1.5Mbps) but fairly
reliable<small><sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></small>. It's also
rather expensive for such modest bandwidth: $602 per month or $7200.00 per year. Since I work at home and there
were no other options I just did what had to be done and paid the bills; some $35,000 to date. But, going forward
I have two concerns. One is that I hope to retire in the next year or three, and that $7,200 annual tab is going
to loom a lot larger on a retirement income. Also, based on extensive discussions with our LEC (Local Exchange Carrier, Verizon) technicians
and some research, I'm not sure how much longer the T-1 service (or POTS<small><sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></small>
telephone service) will continue to be an option at any price<small><sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></small>.
<p>
So, that led to an extensive search for alternatives. It didn't take long to realize that only wireless connectivity
was feasible, and that requires adequate proximity or visibility to a WISP "POP" (Point of Presence, i.e. an antenna
or access point). Such antennas are invariably on towers, and there are a lot of towers in the general
area.<small><sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></small> The question then becomes one of which towers are accessible from
a given location, such as my property at 1829 Mount Ephraim Road.
<p>
This spring I hired a local tower services company (the people who install and service towers) to do a "wireless survey". That
is conventionally done by renting a crane to lift a man with binoculars high in the air. This company was just
starting to experiment with drones and I was one of their first trials of that new
technology<small><sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup></small>. The results of that survey showed a clear line of sight
to an expanse of Mar Lu Ridge to the west, where multiple communications towers are located. A local WISP,
<a href="http://telegia.com/">Telegia</a>, already has a presence on one of those towers, and confirmed that
they could provide much higher speed service for a much better price. For instance, their 20Mbps down/10Mbps up
service for $100 a month would save me $6,000 a year while being an order of magnitude faster.
<h3>
The Catch
</h3>
There's always a catch of course, and in this case it's that an antenna here has to be at least 130' in the
air<small><sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup></small> to
have that clear line of sight to the towers on Mar Lu Ridge. A properly engineered tower that tall isn't cheap;
it will cost at least $25,000. Still, at a savings of $6,000 a year that cost would be recouped in roughly five
years.
<p>
The WISP, Telegia, proposes a 5GHz antenna for the "backhaul" connection from the tower here to their tower on
Mar Lu Ridge. That would have no effect on any other neighborhood <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a>,
both because of the different frequency
band and the narrow beamwidth of the parabolic antenna. After researching Telegia's reputation and talking with
Telegia customers I'm convinced that this 5GHz direct line-of-sight service would be as reliable as the current
T-1 line.
<h3>
A "micro-POP"
</h3>
However, Telegia also noted that if they installed a 5GHz link from my tower, they could also use that backhaul
to provide 2.4GHz Wi-Fi service to the immediate neighborhood, i.e. a "micro-POP". 2.4GHz is the traditional "Wi-Fi"
frequency band, and
the standard configuration of three sector or panel antennas in what is called an "ABC" configuration would
occupy all three independent channels within the 2.4GHz band. That may well conflict with other local Wi-Fi usage,
in particular current incumbent WISP customers.<small><sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup></small>
<p>
Note that any willing WISP could manage a micro-POP<small><sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup></small>;
it doesn't have to be Telegia and I have no particular
affiliation or affection for them beyond a favorable impression from some research and our interactions to date.
Unfortunately (but understandably), I have confirmed that the incumbent WISP has no interest in
in being the WISP that provides and manages that micro-POP service.
That leaves Telegia as the WISP of choice for my Wi-Fi service and for the micro-POP.<small><sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup></small>
<p>
So, that leaves an open question for the neighborhood. We'll all be better off using the same WISP, but will
all of the neighbors in near proximity to this tower want to use Telegia as their WISP?
<h3>
Frequently Asked Questions
</h3>
In this section I'll put questions and answers from discussions with the neighbors.
<p>
<p>
<h4>What service options does Telegia provide?</h4>
<p>
Their initial installation cost, for the CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) is $200. Some of you in the very near vicinity
probably can get a good connection directly from your Wi-Fi client devices (laptops, access points, etc.) and
may not need any CPE gear (i.e. a radio+antenna unit on your roof or outside wall). Those further away will need the CPE
radio, just like they have now with the incumbent WISP, but still be only one hop from the micro-POP.
<tt>
<ul>
  <li>$&nbsp;80/month for 10Mbps download x &nbsp;5Mbps upload
  </li>
  <li>$100/month for 20Mbps download x 10Mbps upload
  </li>
  <li>$130/month for 30Mbps download x 15Mbps upload
  </li>
</ul>
</tt>
These rates compare favorably to those of the incumbent WISP on a dollars per Mbps basis, though cheaper
options are offered:
<tt>
<ul>
  <li>$&nbsp;55/month for 2Mbps download x 1&nbsp;&nbsp;Mbps upload
  </li>
  <li>$&nbsp;70/month for 3Mbps download x 1.5Mbps upload
  </li>
  <li>$&nbsp;85/month for 4Mbps download x 2&nbsp;&nbsp;Mbps upload
  </li>
  <li>$100/month for 5Mbps download x 2.5Mbps upload
  </li>
</ul>
</tt>
Note the $70/month plan (nominally) provides faster speeds that I get for $602/month with the T-1 line; oh
how I would prefer to be paying only $70 a month!
<p>
Personally I plan to sign up for the $100/month service; it will be much faster than the current T-1 and I don't want
to become spoiled with high bandwidth so close to retirement and a fixed income. Note even higher bandwidths are
available at higher prices; I could get a lot of bandwidth for the $600/month I'm paying now for narrowband T-1.
<p>
<p>
<h4>Would it make more sense to put this tower somewhere else?</h4>
<p>
Quite possibly, and I'd be thrilled if someone else wanted to install a tower that would give me solid
line-of-sight Wi-Fi service. If anyone's interested I'll be happy to share everything I've learned about
towers over weeks of in-depth investigation.
<p>
But, I suspect I'll be the only one determined (or foolish!) enough to build a suitable tower, for several reasons:
<ul>
  <li>
Cost: towers are expensive; this one will cost $25,000 or so. Some of the local properties have more suitable terrain and
could get by with a shorter tower, but you're still looking at thousands of dollars.
  </li><p>
  <li>
Permits: in initially inquiring about a permit for a "communications tower" I found that the
requirements for such are extensive, requiring thousands of dollars in paperwork and a full blown "Special Exception"
process. But, I had noted that I planned
to put ham radio antennas on the tower and am a licensed ham radio operator (callsign KB3IHF). The very helpful
Frederick County <a href="https://frederickcountymd.gov/4710/Building-Permits-Zoning-Certificates">Permits and Inspections</a>
folks pointed out that permitting for ham radio towers is handled differently<small><sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup></small>
and that on such a tower Wi-Fi
antennas are allowed as an "accessory use". On that basis I have obtained a standard permit for a tower that specifically
allows hosting of a micro-POP (permit #131429). So the applicant for a standard permit for an antenna tower will
need to have a ham radio license<small><sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup></small>.
  </li><p>
  <li>
Backup power: the proposed micro-POP would require a cabinet at the tower base supplied with 120VAC utility power,
preferably uninterruptible. This property already has uninterruptible power (a combined PV and battery bank system
with autostart diesel generator). Absent that power we would lose our internet access and thus (for most of us)
telephone service<small><sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup></small> during a utility power outage.
  </li><p>
  <li>
<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=NIMBY">NIMBY</a>: Who the heck <em>wants</em> a tower in their back yard?
Not us, and this thing will literally be right in our back yard. The
tower base will be about 50' from our house, to the north and east, and will be yet another obstacle to mow around. Most
of the neighbors won't see much of the tower but the top portion that will extend above the treetops, but we'll have
a close-up view of the whole thing from our house. The tower will also require periodic maintenance (occasional inspections
for corrosion and replacement of coax cable that eventually deterioriates in the weather).
  </li><p>
  <li>
Risk (of superfluousness): there is the possibility, however slim, that some other viable means of Internet access could become available
before the investment in the tower could be offset by other savings (five years in my case). I don't think that's likely,
otherwise I'd not be pursuing this option, and in any event I'll still have a first rate ham radio tower as a consolation. But if
Comcast or Verizon or whomever brings decent broadband down Mount Ephraim Road a year after the tower is up it won't
look like a very good investment.
  </li><p>
Risk (of futility): My expectation that the 5GHz line-of-site link to the Telegia POP on Mar Lu Ridge will provide high
quality Internet access may be wrong, or the WISP service may prove inadequate for other reasons, and I may be unable to find
another suitable service. I'm confident enough with my performance expectations to gamble a large investment, but still
recognize it as a risk.
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<h4>Will we have better service than now?</h4>
That's hard to say in general. Those half dozen or so houses that will have direct line of sight to the WISP
antennas on the new tower will definitely see better performance. I think we'll find another half dozen will have only
minimal obstructions and a solid signal. The 2.4GHz Wi-Fi signals degrade rapidly
when obstructed with foliage, which in this area is a major problem. Telegia claims that the micro-POP should
be usable for anyone within a mile radius of the tower<small><sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup></small>,
and they have visited the site and seen the area from the top of our current 60' tower. For those without clear line-of-sight
visibility we won't know for sure until the new antennas are operational. However, those far enough away from
the tower for that micro-POP to be marginal or unusable will also see correspondingly less interference to their current
incumbent WISP service.
<p>
<p>
<a name="elsewhere">
<h4>What do you (the Marquesses) get out of a micro-POP?</h4>
</a>
There are pros and cons for us. On the pro side:
<ul>
  <li> It's traditional for a WISP to provide discounted service to the owner of a site used for a micro-POP,
so we might save on the $100 monthly cost of our service. However, Telegia has made it clear they consider a
micro-POP of only a dozen or so customers economically marginal so that is far from guaranteed. We are
cost-justifying construction of the tower on the basis of the T-1 savings and not assuming any rebate on our
monthly Wi-Fi cost.
  </li><p>
  <li> We'd have the satisfaction of providing our neighbors with a better opportunity for internet access. I know
we're not the only ones dissatisfied with the status quo.
  </li><p>
</ul>
On the con side:
<ul>
  <li>
The three antennas that would be needed for this "micro-POP" service collectively add up to a significant portion of
the total wind load on the tower. That tower is custom designed for the site and specific antenna load, and the
cost is a direct function of that load; the 2.4GHz "micro-POP" antennas increase the cost by a grand or
two<small><sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup></small> over the
cost of a tower sized to support only the 5GHz antenna needed for our Wi-Fi service.
  </li><p>
  <li>
With just a 5GHz antenna providing us service our neighbors will be unaffected by any changes we make, from switching
to another WISP to decommissioning the tower entirely. But, once a micro-POP is operational we're effectively stuck
with it. Suppose, for instance, we find a better deal for us with another WISP; if we switch the backhaul link to
that WISP then the micro-POP has to switch with it<small><sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup></small>. A better deal for
us won't necessarily be a better deal for the micro-POP customers.
  </li><p>
  <li>
Coordinating with the entire neighborhood and Telegia for a micro-POP is going to take time. Now that we have a permit
and a clear understanding of what's involved in building a tower we have a financial incentive to replace our T-1
service with Telegia Wi-Fi sooner rather than later.<small><sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup></small>
  </li><p>
  <li>
No good deed goes unpunished:
we may be blamed if anyone ends up with worse service than before, or if anything at all goes wrong anywhere, or just
because. On the other hand, if we put up this tower to get high quality internet access for ourselves
and <em>didn't</em> host a micro-POP for a WISP willing to provide it we could be blamed for that too ... it's a
bit of a lose-lose situation so we'll try to do the right thing even if that means more complications.
  </li><p>
</ul>
Note incidentally that we will have no part of managing the micro-POP; that will be entirely the responsibility of
the WISP and any neighbor who chooses to become a customer will deal directly with that WISP (we won't even know who
those customers are unless they tell us). A WISP necessarily incurs multiple obligations in that capacity, such
as responsibility for what their customers do with their Internet access (DMCA take-downs, legal service, NSLs, and
so forth). We will very deliberately have no involvement beyond hosting the WISP managed antennas on our tower.

<h4>So Who Exactly Will Be In Range?</h4>
</a>
Good question. Using <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google</a> terrain maps and the Maryland
<a href="http://sdat.resiusa.org/RealProperty/Pages/default.aspx">Real Property</a> database I've come up
with the following list of properties that are close enough to <em>probably</em> have solid connectivity. Here I've taken the
address and owner designations for occupied properties as shown in the SDAT records:
<pre>
<code>
1721 Mount Ephraim	Lankford, John
1749 Mount Ephraim	James, Larry
1803 Mount Ephraim	Carlsson, Per Uno
1805 Mount Ephraim	Bledsoe, John
1819 Mount Ephraim	Clement, Diana
1820 Mount Ephraim	Morrison, Kristen
1829 Mount Ephraim	Marquess, Steven
1840 Mount Ephraim	Toof, David
1846 Mount Ephraim	Danko, David
1875 Mount Ephraim	Gehman, John
1888 Mount Ephraim	Lapsa, Tom
2002 Mount Ephraim	Nicklas, Stephen
2010 Mount Ephraim	Wilkes, Nathan
2104 Mount Ephraim	Freedman, Philip
2116 Mount Ephraim	Harrell, John

</pre>
All of these properties are in tax map 104 (see
<a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/OurProducts/PropertyMApProducts/FinderOnlineProduct.shtml">
FinderOnline</a>). Also in tax maps 104 and 110 are the houses on the plateau traversed
by Ira Sears Road, at least some of which are likely to be within direct range:
<pre>
<code>
7104 IRA SEARS RD	LLOYD MICHAEL WILL

7130 IRA SEARS RD	NIBLOCK THOMAS C &
7144 IRA SEARS RD	JORDAN RICK M &
7233 IRA SEARS RD	MACKINTOSH ANDREW
7303 IRA SEARS RD	SEARS EARL F ETAL
7386 IRA SEARS RD	BRADFORD WALLACE L
</code>
</pre>
<p>
We're spread fairly thinly here so this not a long list; that's the essence of the problem
in getting any Internet service providers to take an interest in this area.
<p>
Parts of Parks Mills Road may be in range also, though the beamline angle
will be pretty low and thus intersected by a lot of foliage.
<p>
[update 2016-08015] I've figured out how to use Google Earth to do a
<a href="http://binaryimpulse.com/2014/06/google-earth-elevation-profiles/">elevation profile</a>
between the antenna tower and another location. I've also found an interesting Google Earth based
<a href="http://www.heywhatsthat.com/">service</a> that can generate a
<a href="heywhatsthat-full.png">coverage map</a> for the areas with line of sight visibility to
the tower.

<p>
<p>
<h4>What Level of Interest is Needed for the micro-POP?</h4>
The tower itself is not dependent on the micro-POP; it's
already permitted and I'm on to the next stage (getting the geotechnical
report which alas looks like it will cost several thousand more than I'd
hoped). This was the original plan; the micro-POP only became a
consideration when the prospective WISP (Telegia) suggested it.
<p>
Some minimal level of community interest is necessary for the micro-POP
for two reasons; us and Telegia, neither of whom will want to proceed absent
some significant indication of interest. Telegia claims (correctly I
believe) that they are not interested in encroaching on the incumbent WISP turf
for just a handful of customers, and that the micro-POP won't be hugely lucrative for them in any event.
If they don't think they have a good chance of signing up at least a half dozen customers
they probably won't be interested in installing the additional hardware
needed for the micro-POP.
<p>
They could of course install the micro-POP antennas at any future point
in time after the tower is up, but only if that tower has sufficient
capacity to support them. I will be tempted to avoid that extra cost if
I'm not reasonably confident there's a point to it.
<h3>What Happens Next</h3>
Planning an coordination has taken a long time, but the construction process has started. The geotechnical
bore samples were taken on September 17. Starting at that point the actual tower construction will be
documented on a <a href="tower.html">separate web page</a>.

At this request of this WISP (personal communication 2015-06-29) I have not named them explicitly. If you're one of the residents
in this immediate area you will know who they are, and if not the specific identity of this WISP is irrelevant. While I found that
WISP inadequate for my purposes (I was a customer for a couple of years), they have long provided the only affordable Internet
access for many of my neighbors.

We've gone months at a time with no service interruptions. But, during the period June 15 to June 23 we had
interruptions totaling over 16 hours of complete outage, effectively shutting down the home office here for
several days. The T-1 line runs through 40,000 feet of overhead cable and two "doublers" (electronic gadgets
to amplify the signal) to the Verizon Central Office (CO) south of Buckeystown; a
Wi-Fi link to a WISP will span about the same distance. But, the T-1 cables run through wooded areas
and are subject to treefalls and evil cable-gnawing squirrels; the Wi-Fi link will traverse only clear air.
It should be more reliable than the T-1.

</small>
TL;DR: Verizon wants to get out of the residential/consumer wireline business entirely, and is neglecting the wireline ("UTP"
or "copper", the overhead phone lines running to our homes) infrastructure. This is a well documented objective, see for
instance
<a href="https://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Utility-Verizon-To-Exit-Wireline-Business-Within-10-Years-133693">Verizon To Exit Wireline Business Within 10 Years</a>.
That wireline service won't be shut down immediately once Verizon succeeds in ditching it, but it will go to a "value
extraction" business like Century Link that is unlikely to extend or improve that service. Rumor has it Century Link wants
to acquire only the commercial wireline business, and Verizon is insisting that Century Link take over residential service as
well.
The T-1 line is a commercial service, but is also the
only such service in this immediate area and thus will also be vulnerable when the plug is inevitably pulled on the residential
service that uses the same copper infrastructure.

Not only was it more fun to see the drone in action, <em>and</em> get digital photos and video, but it also cost me only $500
instead of a thousand dollars or so for a crane rental. I talked to one crane operator who wasn't even sure he could get his
crane into the necessary position on our property; I would have had to use another service with an all-terrain crane.

The fixed tower structure will be 140' tall, with a rotating mast extending an additional 8' higher that will carry
three ham radio antennas (an HF beam antenna, a UHF/VHF Yagi, and a multi-band vertical). The entire antenna
structure can be used as an antenna on the 160m band, via a gamma shunt feed. The parabolic Wi-Fi antenna will
be attached to the fixed tower at a lower height as there needs to be some separation between the different kinds
of antennas to avoid interference.

Wi-Fi uses unlicensed radio frequencies, in what is known as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band">ISM (Industrial, Scientific, Medical)</a> portion of
the electromagnetic spectrum. Within the allowed power levels, anyone is allowed to transmit on those
frequencies and no specific use or users have any exclusivity. There is no legal means for one permitted
unlicensed user to prevent interference from any other permitted unlicensed use, even if the result is
that both desired uses are ruined. As a result WISPs tend to operate in de facto territories and try to
avoid competing in the same geographical location, as a failure to informally coordinate use of that
unlicensed spectrum leaves everyone worse off.
<p>
<small>
<sup>

</small>
Strictly speaking a WISP is not required; Wi-Fi technology isn't rocket science, the hardware is
pretty affordable, and any enterprising neighbor could lease space on a commercial tower (I talked to a
couple of tower owners; that's what those towers are for) and manage both ends of the connection. But, that
neighbor won't be me as I already manage five companies in some capacity; I don't need the headaches of
another no matter how small.

Needless to say I'm more than a little leery of putting all my eggs in one basket, especially when that basket is going
to cost some $25,000. So I did research the possibility of utilizing WISPs other than Telegia or the incumbent WISP.
I concluded that while it would be preferable to use a nearby local WISP, there are
other options as a fallback.

Long story short, federal regulations preempt local restrictions on ham radio antennas
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/97.15">46 CFR 97.15(b)</a>. This is also known as
<a href="http://www.antennazoning.com/attachments/PRB1_Article.pdf">PRB-1</a>.
There is a comparable type of exception for windmill towers. But, a windmill would interfere with antennas and would have a
huge windload that would drive up the cost of the tower substantially.

One other neighbor is a licensed ham radio operator (it's easy enough to
<a href="http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/searchLicense.jsp">check</a>). However, that ham's property isn't
any more promising as a tower site than mine.

We don't get a usable cell signal inside the house here. I converted all our landlines to VoIP (Voice over IP)
shortly after getting the
T-1 line; VoIP is far cheaper (which matters when you have 10 phone numbers like I do) and as reliable. I have
kept one POTS line for calling <a href="http://www.level3.com/en/">Level 3</a> (our T-1 service provider) when
the T-1 line goes down. The POTS line tends to fail about as often as the T-1 line, though fortunately not always
at the same time.

That's a half-mile radius for a direct link from a CPE radio to the WISP micro-POP antennas. The range could be
extended further with multiple hops (from micro-POP antenna to one CPE radio to another CPE radio, and so on). But,
those extra hops inevitably degrade the quality of the Wi-Fi service, as do obstructions (foliage) between any two nodes.

I don't know the exact cost because that is a function of two factors: the cost of the tower "package" (the above
ground metal structure)
and the foundation. The foundation will need thousands of dollars of concrete and fabricated rebar, but I won't have an exact
design until I commit to purchase of the tower package and pay for the geotechnical soil report. That report alone will cost
at least $1,500. Only at that point will I have a complete design from which to estimate total tower costs. However, from
several iterations with <a href="http://www.rohnproducts.com/">Rohn</a> of tentative tower designs I have a
pretty good feel for how the cost varies, and that is quite
sensitive to the total EPA ("Effective Projected Area") of the antennas.

Unless a second backhaul antenna was installed on the tower, one for the old WISP serving the micro-POP and one for
the new WISP providing us with Wi-Fi service. Depending on the location of the destination tower hosting the new WISP
coexistence of those antennas may not be possible, and the tower may not be able to accommodate the additional wind
load. Two full-coverage 2.4GHz micro-Pops would definitely not be able to coexist on the same tower.

Our T-1 service is under a three year contract that comes up for renewal in December 2016, or $9,000 from
now. Nominally that contract can't be terminated prematurely, and I'd assumed I'd be stuck with it no matter
what. However, a well-placed Verizon source recently informed me that because of the high ongoing costs of
maintaining my T-1 service, I would indeed be allowed to terminate early. So if I move expeditiously to
build this tower this summer instead of moving leisurely as originally planned I could save another $5-7K.
