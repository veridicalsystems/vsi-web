Tower Delivery

<h2>
Delivery
</h2>
<div align="left">
From the tower design paperwork I knew the total tower weight was about 9,000 pounds, but had no idea how that
would be packaged for delivery. The equipment I have available is a pneumatic tired forklift with
a lift capacity of 5,000 lbs (typical for a forklift) and 42" forks, and a fork attachment for the
front end loader (FEL) on my small diesel tractor. The FEL has a lift capacity of only about 1,500
pounds but a further reach. Given the weight of the shipment and that there were twenty-one tower legs twenty feet long,
weighing from 150 to 400 pounds each, it was a pretty good bet the delivery would be on a flatbed
trailer (which turned out to be the case).
<p>
If the load was distributed in multiple pallets or bundles of under 5,000 pounds then I could
just lift the pallets or bundles directly off the flatbed. If not I'd either have to rent larger equipment or unload a
piece at a time. On multiple occasions over a couple of months, each time it looked
like we were close to having the tower finished, I begged the manufacturer to give me a heads-up on
how the load would be packaged.
<p>
<h3>Shipment</h3>
So at 5 PM on a Friday I get a terse E-mail message from the manufacturer saying the tower delivery would
be the following Monday. No time, no carrier info, no details at all. Fortunately with a frantic
series of phone calls I was able to talk to the shipping broker and eventually the truck driver. The
driver (John) was great, he E-mailed me photos of the load:

<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<p>
One huge skid with all the major tower parts banded together, 9,300 lbs, and one small (500lb) pallet
that presumably has the small hardware components (nuts and bolts). So much for picking pallets off
the truck with a forklift.
<p>
After pondering a bit and a phone call and E-mail exchanges with John, I decided to unload at the
school bus turnaround about a quarter mile further down the road from my property. We'll obviously
need to cut the bands on the big skip and pick up the tower legs one or two at a time. Those legs
weight between 150 and 400 lbs each; to heavy for a couple of people to muscle around.
<p>
I plan to pre-stage the tractor/FEL and some cribbing (4x4 lumber and a half dozen spare pallets) at
the turnaround Monday morning. Then when the truck arrives I'll drive down to the turnaround in a
pickup to meet it. We'll cut the bands and pick up the tower legs a piece or two at a time and restack
on the ground. After the truck leaves I'll use my 16' flatbed equipment trailer to carry up to a half-dozen
or so tower legs at a time to the tower site. With luck I'll have at least one volunteer helper to
ferry me back and forth during that process, as I'll need at least a half-dozen rund trips.
