<h2>Automatic Generator Start (AGS) Issues</h2>
<div align="left">
Since troubleshooting the Schneider/Xantrex Automatic Generator Start (AGS) is turning out to be
an extended and significant effort, I'm collecting information here for ready access.
<p>
<h3>Background</h3>
The Xantrex AGS is used to autostart a 5KW diesel generator. Brief grid outages of a few seconds
are common here, and the 16KWh battery bank is capable of carrying the critical loads for several
hours. The desired behavior of the AGS is that the generator will be started only when the Xantrax
hybrid inverter is inverting, and the battery
voltage has dropped to a level consistent with a significant (20-25%) state of discharge, <em>or</em>
the critical loads are at a higher than normal level. The AGS documentation<small><sup>1</sup></small> indicates such a
configuration is possible but in practice we have been unable to achieve anything even close. In
particular the AGS is prone to starting the generator for no discernable reason, often shutting it
down immediately but also sometimes leaving it running for hours when grid power is available and
the batteries are fully charged.
<p>
In the hope of aiding the troubleshooting process a
<a href="http://www.schneider-electric.com/products/ww/en/7000-solar-off-grid-and-back-up/7030-monitoring/62089-conext-combox/">
Conext Combox</a>
 device was purchased and installed,
and configured to log relevant status parameters at five second intervals (the finest granularity
possible). The generator itself was disabled by disconnecting power from the internal DC bus used by
internal remote start controller and the Xantrex AGS was configured to support automatic generator
starts triggered by either battery voltage or high inverter loads. The complete configuration of
the AGS and the XW 6048 hybrid inverter are recorded in text file form <a href="xantrex.txt">here</a>.
<p>
After a week the logs were pulled (manually by removing the SD card; the web based log viewer in the
Combox is worthless) and analyzed. For the period 2014-08-22 through 2014-08-31 inclusive, there were
16 false starts; 12 on the 22nd and one each on the 23rd, 25th, 27th, and 31st. Inverter mode was
logged only one time during that entire week, on the 31st corresponding to that false start (and only
for 15 seconds). These
logs can be seen <a href="logs/">here</a>; both the raw CVS logs and selected content converted to
spreadsheet format.
<h3>Gory Details</h3>
The AGS and XW 6048 were upgraded to the latest available firmware before this latest set of logs was obtained.
<p>
The installation of the AGS doesn't appear to be suspect, but the entire wiring scheme from the generator
internals to the AGS unit is documented in
<a href="genwiring.txt">excruciating detail</a>. For ease
of troubleshooting multiple 24V LED indicator lights were added to show all relevant control signals. The AGS
interconnections and indicator lights can be seen in this <a href="../../MEP802A/wallpanel1.jpg">photo</a>.
Note that once it became clear that debugging the AGS was going to be a non-trivial exercise I purchased
a second Xantrex SCP (System Control Panel) accessible from the location where the AGS and wiring were
installed<small><sup>2</sup></small>.
<p>
Per the documentation the AGS is not supposed to start the generator via the "Strt Load" trigger unless
the threshold current (10.0A here) is exceeded for five minutes, and only when the XW is in inverter mode.
That clearly isn't the case as almost all of the false starts occur when the XW is not inverting.
<p>One theory that has been advanced by Xantrex tech support is that the XW is inverting for an interval
too brief to be noticed or to be logged by the Combox (which cannot log more frequently than 5 second intervals).
I think that unlikely because of the Bogard Engineering "Trimetric" State-of-Charge controller that is
monitoring the battery bank. It is configured to recognize the batteries as fully charged when the battery
voltage exceeds 54.3 volts <em>and</em> the current is less than 7.0 amps. However, it continues to accumulate
watt-hours so the percentage SoC indication increments beyond 100%. If any current is drawm <em>from</em>
the battery bank, even for a millisecond, the SoC indication immediately resets to 100%<small><sup>3</sup></small>.
I initially thought
that behavior annoying, and complained to the manufacturer who confirmed it as a "feature not a bug", but now
consider it a useful feature as I can tell at a glance roughly how long it's been since the last grid glitch.
<p>
Initially I thought the AGS was triggering the generator start based on AC output load even when the XW
was clearly not in inverter mode, but after much experimentation and observation I don't see any pattern
at all. Attempts to cause a false start by sustaining a load above the "Strt Load" threshold for more than
five minutes have failed, and false starts have occurred when the load was minimal or even negative (with a
grid tied inverter backfeeding the critical loads panel connected to the XW 6048 AC Out).
<p>
Note that the Combox does not properly recognize a power export from the critical loads (when the backfeed from
the interactive inverter into the critical loads panel exceeds the power consumption from that panel, which
usually occurs during daylight hours). Both the logs and the web portal graphical display show zero for negative
power flows. However, the SCPs do correctly report negative power consumption from AC Out and the false starts
have been observed with power consumption positive (and above the Strt Load threashold, when not inverting),
positive (and well below Strt Load), zero, and negative. Whatever is triggering those starts isn't obvious.
<p>
A number of the parameters the Combox logs appear to be dubious, like "XW AC Load Current" and
"System XW Load Power" for which improbable values are sometimes logged. The Combox also occassionally writes
spurious garbage in the CVS log files. It's possible the Combox is also incorrectly logging the generator
status parameters as well, though the generator starts are real enough.
<p>
<h4>Detailed Log Analysis - short-cycle misfires</h4>
Schneider/Xantrax tech support has asked for an analysis of the logs (which were also provided to them in full). So
here's my analysis of a representative false start on 08-27. I picked that day because there was only the
one false start that appears to be most representative of such events (08-25 is comparable). The raw log file is
<a href="logs/0827.cvs">0827.CVS</a> and the relevant records extracted to Excel spreadsheet format is
aa href="
<a href="http://solar.schneider-electric.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/503-0247-01-01_RevA.1_Modbus_Map_AGS_Device.pdf">AGS</a>
and
<a href="http://solar.schneider-electric.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/503-0246-01-01_RevA.1_Modbus_Map_Conext_XW_Device.pdf">XW</a>.
<p>
The false start begins at 06:53:00. The <em>Generator On</em> reason is "AC Current High" (3), the <em>Generator Off Reason</em>
when the run signal is dropped 30 seconds later at 06:53:30 is "AC Good" (21). Note the <em>XW Inverter Status</em> remains
"AC Pass Through" (1025) throughout. At that time the
<em>SYSTEM Load Output Power</em> is 926W, <em>XW Load AC Current</em> is 9.5A, <em>XW Load AC L1 Current</em> is 3.4A and
<em>XW Load AC L2 Current</em>
is 6.2A. The total of L1 and L2 is 9.6A, close to the <em>XW Load AC Current</em> (in some of the logs <em>XW Load AC Current</em>
is recorded as zero but L1 and L2 usually appear to have sensible values).
<p>
Note in particular that:
<ol type="a">
<li> the XW 6048 never enters "Invert" mode (or if it does it's for less than five seconds<small><sup>4</sup></small>).
<li> the AC Load is never greater than 10.0A (the Strt Load setting), not for five minutes per the Xantrex AGS
documentation and not for even five seconds
<li> the run signal is dropped in only 30 seconds, whereas the Xantrex AGS documentaiton states that the Stop Load
trigger requires a full minute below the Stop Load current threshold (7.0A here).
<li> AC2 (generator input) is not logged because the generator was completely disabled throughout this logging period
(I didn't see the point in continually abusing the generator with multiple short-cycle false starts).
</ol>
If I can get some sort of resolution of this type of incident I'll move on to the more complicated events that were logged on
08-22 and 08-23 where the run signal was sustained for hours with grid power available and without the XW 6048 ever
entering "Invert" mode.
<h4>Hypotheses</h4>
I'm getting input from a number of interested spectators. One suggestion is that EMI may be an issue. That is plausible
given that the utility power here is fairly "dirty", with brief outages and voltage sags being rather common. I
don't have the equipment to quantify the problem, but we see the lights flicker and when I'm in my office I hear
the squealing and beeping from multiple UPSes.
<p>
That said we haven't noticed any problems<small><sup>5</sup></small> during the year and a half before the AGS was installed.
That is powered only from the Xanbus and so presumably would be isolated from line power noise.
<p>
The XW 6048 is about 20' from a main lug service entrance panel which is fed from a main disconnect about 50'
away where the neutral-ground bonding occurs. The grounding conductor goes to two ground rods by the utility meter
(another 10' or so). Those two ground rods are connected to the ground plane system of an adjacent radio tower
via a 4" wide by 25 gage (0.022") copper strap. The ground plane system consists of a 30' diameter ring of copper strap and
six ground rods. The ground lug bar in the SE panel is also connected to a new ground rod installed with
the PV system that is about 20' away. The 240V feed to the XW 6048 (grid input or "AC1") is properly grounded
to the SE, and that to the main disconnect.
<p>
Schneider/Xantrex tech support asks periodically about the Xanbus (Xantrex proprietary version of Modbus) network cabling.
The Xantrex documentation specifies a maximum length of 131' (40m) for the entire network. Recently they also began
documenting a requirement that no single segment (between any two XW devices) be less than 6.5' (2m) in length. The
network topology is as follows (also at the end of the detailed <a href="xantrex.txt">configuration document</a>).
<pre>
Xanbus wiring	T == RS485 120ohm terminator
		Cat5e, minimum cable length 6.5' 2m), max total network length 131' (40m)
		Documentation says use T568A termination but Xantrex tech support confirmed
		that consistent use of T568B is fine (that is the in-house standard)

	[SCP bmst]	[AGS     ]	[XW  6048]	[Combox  ]	[SCP up  ]
            T\______7'______/\______13'_____/\______7'______/\______49'_____/T

</pre>
Total length of the network is approximately 76', give or take a couple of feet. The two 7' segments are
factory made and the two longer segments were site terminated.
<p>
All cables are Cat5e and either factory terminated with molded connectors or site made with an RJ45
crimp tool and molded boots, and checked with a <em>TENMA 72-6709 Network Cable Tester Pro</em> Cat5 cable tester
for wiremap, twist, and shorts. The Xantrex documentation calls for T568A termination but the local standard here for
the several thousand feet of installed Cat5e is T568B. Most factory made Cat5 Ethernet cables come that way too. I
know from working with Ethernet that "A" and "B" terminations are equivalent as long as both ends of the cable are
done the same<small><sup>6</sup></small>, and Xantrex tech support agreed with that at the time the Xantrex XW 6048
was first installed.
<h3>Current Status</h3>
While still hoping for a resultion via Xantrex tech support I'm facing the realization that it
may be necessary to kludge some other solution. Some options are considered in the following section. I don't
want to invest yet more time and money in workarounds until, hopefully, I have a better understanding of
why the AGS is misbehaving as it does. At the moment the false starts appear to be completely unpredictable
which is going to make any workaround more difficult.
<p>
I will update this section with any new information.
<p>
UPDATE 2014-09-04: Xantrex tech support has concluded that the AGS device is defective and will replace it
even though I can't find the proof of purchase paperwork. They wanted the paper sticker bar code on the
<a href="AGSback.jpg">back</a>.
<p>
UPDATE 2014-09-05: I received a call from a new person at Schneider/Xantrex who says the logs indicate a problem
with the AGS or XW 6048 hardware. I sure hope it's the former as replacing the XW 6048 would be a pain. He
said Schneider would replace the AGS, even though I've lost the proof-of-purchase paperwork.
<p>
UPDATE 2014-09-15: The new AGS was received on Saturday. It came pre-loaded with a very new firmware version,
3.00.00 BN 2. When installed the Conext Combox didn't recognize it but after digging around on the Schneider
web site I found a very new version Conbox firmware upgrade, Ver02.00BN0656. On installing that the Combox did
recognize the new AGS. Unfortunately the new AGS is exhibiting exactly the same false start behavior as before.
It didn't take long to capture one; event <a href="logs/0915.xls">0915.xls</a> occurred only a few
minutes after I enabled
Automatic mode on Monday morning. The generator was enabled and connected to the AGS up so there was an actual
start. As before the
XW did not enter invert mode. The load as shown by "XW Load AC Power" did not exceed 1100W from the point
where Automatic mode was enabled until the false start. However, I noticed something interesting: the false
start occurred exactly five minutes after automatic mode was enabled and "XW Load AC Current" exceeded 10.0A
(the AC High start trigger threshold). It's as if the AGS/XW were ignoring the fact that the XW wasn't inverting.
<p>I'm a bit puzzled at the discrepancy between "XW Load AC Power" at <1100W, "XW Load AC Power - Apparent" at
<1400VA, and "XW Load AC Current" at ~11.5A which is roughly 2700W. That's quite a discrepancy.
Autostart is disabled again pending feedback from Schneider/Xantrax tech support.
<p>
I still hope to eventually resolve the issues with the Xantrex AGS, but I meantime I called Ralph Hiesey of
<a href="http://www.bogartengineering.com/">Bogart Engineering</a>
to confirm the suitability of the Pentametric state-of-charge monitor for generator starting.
That ended up being a very long and informative call touching on almost every aspect of my complex PV grid-tied
off-grid system and I learned a number of things of interest. I was pleased to hear that the Pentametric could
share a shunt with the Trimetric meter that is already in use, saving me the hassle of redoing that installation
in the upstairs hallway wall. After that call I ordered the Pentametric PM-5000-U
and PM-101-CE products and downloaded the documentation with the intention of configuring the Pentametric to
autostart the generator based on state-of-charge levels, either as an adjunct to the Xantrex AGS or as a complete
replacement. I'd still really like to be able to start the generator based on high inverter loads but that may
not be possible.
<p>
UPDATE 2014-09-16: Schneider/Xantrex tech support says that since the new AGS didn't fix the problem it must
reside in the XW 6048 inverter, and they will replace that under warranty. Since the legacy XW 6048 has been
discontinued I will receive the newer XW+NA 6848. After a quick glance at the specs that appears to be at
least as good and probably a step up in performance<sup>7</sup></small>. I just hope the replacement won't require extensive rework
of the EMT conduit.
<p>
UPDATE 2014-09-20: I was told by Schneider/Xantrex tech support on 2014-09-17 that I would
need to upgrade the SCPs to firmware version 865-1050-01.02_00_00.BN0013.xf0. That was a bit puzzling as
the SCPs are currently at version "1.06.00 BN 19" which appears to be newer, but on 2014-09-18 I gave it
a try. The Combox will not recognize 865-1050-01.02_00_00.BN0013.xf0 as a valid upgrade option, whereas it
does recognize the 865-1050.01_06_00.BN0019.xf0 I used for the earlier upgrade to "1.06.00 BN 19". I reported
that result to Schneider/Xantrex tech support but have not received a response yet (it typically takes a
couple of days to get a response, if any, to such queries).
<p>
In the meantime I have received and partially installed the Pentametric battery monitor (PM-5000-U input unit
and PM-101-CE Ethernet interface). A fuse holder is on order for the battery bank connection but in the meantime
I've powered it up with a standalone DC power supply and have configured the Ethernet connectivity. Unlike most
such gadgets the Pentametric does not provide a web server interface, instead Bogart supplies the source code
to a dedicated utility that uses a custom homegrown protocol on TCP port 1701. That did compile successfully
(with one tweak) on an Ubuntu 12.04 system. The Pentametric
will drive an external relay (also on order) by programmable battery voltage and SoC thresholds. If we can get
the AGS to work it will be used for load based generator starts and the Pentametric for SoC based starts. If not
then the Pentametric will be used exclusively for generator starting.
<p>
<a name="2014-09-24"></a>
UPDATE 2014-09-24: The frustration continues. The new XW+6848 inverter is scheduled to arrive tomorrow (I
received a call from the shipping company), but I'm still unable to upgrade either SCP to the "1.02 BN 13"
firmware version I'm told is necessary for that new inverter. This remains the case even after upgrading the
Combox yet again, to Ver02.01BN0673 which was only released on Sept. 22. The latest Schneider tech support
contact doesn't appear to believe that I'm doing the upgrade properly, so I've prepared some screen shots as
proof:
<p>
A screenshot showing the current Combox <a href="combox-1.png">software version</a> (upgraded earlier today).
<p>
A screenshot showing the unzipping of the <a href="shell-1.png">SCP firmware file</a>.
<p>
A screenshot showing the <a href="combox-2.png">start</a> of the upload of that file to the Combox.
<p>
A screenshot showing the <a href="combox-3.png">completion</a> of the upload.
<p>
A screenshot showing the <a href="combox-4.png">pick list</a> that does <em>not</em> include the just uploaded firmware version. Note
the older "1.06.00 BN 19" still appears as I don't know how to remove it without completely wiping the Combox
configuration (and anyway the "1.02 BN 13" upgrade was tried first).
<p>
<a name="2014-10-06"></a>
UPDATE 2014-10-06:
The resolution of the firmware upgrade issue was simple once finally known: I was instructed to rename the file
865-1050-01.02_00_00.BN0013.xf0 to 865-1050.02_00_00.BN0013.xf0 (i.e., remove the "-01"). That did the trick.
<p>
The new XW+6848 arrived as promised and was installed on 2014-09-27. I did the installation strictly by the book,
including use of a <a href="XW+6848-torque.jpg">torque wrench</a> for tightening the terminal
<a href="XW+6848-connections.jpg">connections</a><small><sup>8</sup></small>.
No false starts at first, even with
"AC Current Level To Start" at 3.0A and "AC Current Trigger Start Delay" at 0.5 minutes to encourage any misbehavior.
Hurray!! I was starting to be cautiously optimistic about an end to this long ordeal.
But then on 2014-10-05 I was demonstrating the multiple means of stopping or disabling the generator to my wife, in
preparation for an upcoming trip that will have me overseas for several days (at this point my wife doesn't trust
the autostart controls at all). I engaged the manual start inhibit switch that I've wired into the transfer switch
panel. This is wired across leads 5 and 10 of the AGS, and generates a F203 fault code and reverts the generator
state to "Manual Off" when closed<small><sup>9</sup></small>.
<p>
Immediately after closing that switch, clearing the fault code, and re-enabling Automatic mode the AGS enabled the
run signal. This with the XW still in AC Pass Through mode. Arruggh ... the same false start issue that has plagued
us all along.
<p>
I found that to be repeatable; each time I set to Manual Off mode and then back to Automatic the AGS will now
enable the generator run signal (the generator itself has long been disconnected from AGS control). This after a week
during which no false starts were observed. I have no idea why this is happening now.
I did manually run the generator (disconnected from the AGS, but with AC2 power visible to the XW) a couple
of days ago. Yesterday I power cycled the Combox (by disconnecting the Xanbus cable) as it had stopped responding.
Then the run inhibit switch test. Perhaps one of those events was the provocation?
<p>
As an experiment I disconnected all the Xanbus devices except the AGS, the XW, and the Combox (AGS-XW-Combox). I
used brand
new Cat5e cables. Note that with this configuration <em>everything</em> has been replaced since the false starts
were first experienced: the AGS has been replaced, the Combox is brand new with firmware upgraded twice, the XW+6848
is brand new as of a week ago. The cables are new (two factory made 7' Cat5e patch cables), and I even dug out two
new RS485 terminators. So <em>every</em> single component of the configuration has been replaced.
<p>
The false start is still occurring! With the "AC Current High" trigger, with the XW <em>not</em> inverting.
<p>
As a second experiment I replaced the Combox with an SCP (SCP-AGS-XW, again with two new 7' Cat5e cables). Same result.
So, we can rule out the cables as the problem occurs with multiple cables. We can rule out the Combox and the SCP
as the problem occurs with those components completely absent. This problem has occurred with two different AGS
devices and with two different XW devices.
<p>
At this point I'm left with the conclusion that the Schneider/Xantrex/Conext hardware/firmware is defective by design.
Remember this false start issue has persisted across multiple
hardware and firmware upgrades, to the point where every single component, both hardware and software including all
cables and terminators, has been replaced. yet, the problem persists. I don't think we can still credibly assume any
type of single-sample hardware defect.
<p>
I'm not terribly optimistic about a solution at this point, though I will cooperate fully with Schneider tech
support if they have any more ideas (any solution will involve a firmware upgrade at a minimum, I think).
<p>
Note to Schneider tech support: I reiterate my earlier offer to configure direct access to the Combox. I'll just
need your source IP address(es) to get you through the three firewalls it sits behind. You could then review the
device configurations and cause and observe the false starts yourself.
<p>
<a name="2014-10-09"></a>
UPDATE 2014-10-09:
After a phone discussion with Schneider/Xantrex tech support my contact concurred that the firmware was buggy and
said that resolution would need to be escalated to the firmware maintainers. I disabled the load based triggers,
in addition to disconnecting AGS harness leads 5, 6, and 12 as recommended.
<p>
I left the "Exercise" trigger enabled, and this morning I experienced the first exercise event with the
generator actually connected. Unfortunately the AGS immediately killed the run signal right after asserting it,
and then continued to repeat those short starts every 115 seconds until I disabled the AGS. This
<a href="exercise.xls">log extract</a> shows the first few of those abortive starts. I don't know how long it
would have continued those short starts, but if continued for very long that would be pretty rough on the generator.
<p>
So, I can't use the AGS for load based starts and I can't use it for periodic exercising. I've not yet seen
problems with voltage based false starts, but since the Pentametric also does voltage based triggers (in
addition to SoC) that isn't of much interest even if it worked reliably. The AGS is thus useless until and if
the false start problem is addressed, and will be disconnected until and if Schneider has new firmware that
purports to do so.
<p>
<a name="2014-10-10"></a>
UPDATE 2014-10-10:
I received notice from Schneider tech support yesterday that the firmware developers in Canada have confirmed
a firmware bug. No ETA for updated firmware was given, but it's a relief to have that confirmation as usually
the hardest part of solving this type of problem is just recognizing that there is a problem. The "Exercise"
mode problem is assumed to be a consequence of the same bug.
<p>
I was was also asked for a photo of the installation. A shot of the
<a href="../../MEP802A/wallpanel1.jpg">initial AGS installation</a>
is already on this web page, but I took one of the <a href="wall_panel.jpg">current configuration</a>. Notice it's
gotten a lot more complex as I struggled to debug the autostart problems; I added more indicator lights and a time
delay relay in the hope of filtering out some of the shorter false starts<small><sup>10</sup></small>. I've also added
the Pentametric SoC
meter which is now the means of controlling generator start. Note some of the leads and an indicator light are
dangling loose as I wait to see what the final configuration will look like. I will probably end up with seven LED
indicators which will require another cast aluminum box as seen to the left of the SCP. The AGS will be used only
for manual generator stop/start via the SCPs or Combox, with all start triggers disabled, and will be removed
entirely the first time it misbehaves in that minimal configuration.
<p>
I've also posted an <a href="genwiring.txt">ASCII art<small><sup>11</sup></small> wiring diagram</a>
corresponding to that current configuration. That is intended for my use and so describes a lot more
than just the Schneider AGS configuration; it includes the Inova Tech autostart board and the Pentametric
SoC meter and relay.
<p>
<a name="2014-10-13"></a>
UPDATE 2014-10-13: Schneider has confirmed that they have reproduced the false start issue which will take an
indeterminate amount of time to resolve. In the interim they advise us to "...put the AGS into STANDBY when
you don't want the gen to start automatically". Well, the whole point of the AGS is to start the generator
automatically (that's the "A" in "AGS"). So the AGS is disconnected and we are using the Bogart Pentametric SoC
meter to handle generator autostart. That has behaved reliably with no false starts.
<p>
For now the Schneider AGS is still installed, although electrically disconnected. If and when Schneider
releases new AGS firmware I'll give it at least a brief try, but if it still shows any proclivity for false
starts it will be removed entirely and discarded (I couldn't in good conscience sell it on Craigslist or Ebay).
<h3>Possible Workarounds</h3>
Unfortunately many days of consultation with Schneider/Xantrex technical support have not brought much
hope of a resolution. With something like $10K invested in the Xantrex hardware and generator switching
to a different product mix is unfortunately not a viable option, so I've been considering my options
for external workarounds to what appear to be uncorrectable software bugs in the Xantrex hardware.
<p>
I have discussed the problem extensively with Peter Albrecht of
<a href="http://inovahightech.com/">Inova Hightech, Ltd.</a> who has
been most helpful. The short false starts of a few seconds duration, which seem to be most common,
could be filtered out with a standard time delay relay. I will install one just to protect against short-cycle
abuse of
the generator, but that will not address the issue of the long term (many minutes to many hours) false
starts that have been recorded. Peter has also offered to reprogram the Invoa autostart board to perform the
delay function in software (e.g. ignoring a run signal until it persists for N seconds).
<p>A NO relay with a 120V coil powered from the grid could be used to disable autostarting of the
generator entirely when grid power was present. That relay would need a time delay so a grid
hiccup during an outage wouldn't immediately kill the generator. However, that relay would prevent
scheduled exercising of
the generator (currently configured for 21 days) which I consider a valuable feature. The purist in me also
dislikes the idea that a coil will be energized almost the time, even if the power consumption is only a
few watts. Inova is developing
a fancier autostart board for this generator that will include an exercise function, so that is a
possible (albeit expensive) alternative if such a grid cutout relay is used. I'm assuming of course
that the Xantrex AGS doesn't fail to start the generator when it should; so far I've only seen false
starts but we haven't had any generator-worthy outages yet.
<p>
Yet another and even more expensive option would be to discard the Xantrex AGS entirely and replace it
with an independent autostart controller. The Inova board provides true "two wire" start
capability<small><sup>12</sup></small> so the
external controller only needs to close a set of dry relay contacts to signal the generator to start.
Some off-the-shelf hardware of that type is apparently available
but at least some custom development would probably be necessary to handle the battery DC voltage trigger.
Such a project would exceed my electronics skills and enthusiasm and so would require some outside assistance.
I've made some preliminary inquiries and it appears that
could be done for about what I've already spent on the Xantrex hardware<small><sup>2</sup></small>.
UPDATE: there appear to several off-the-shelf solutions that could replace the Xantrex AGS entirely, such as
the Victron BMV-600S monitor and the
<a href="http://www.bogartengineering.com/products/PentaMetric">Bogart Pentametric</a>. Since I'm already using the
Bogart Trimetric monitor and am happy with it I'll probably try the Pentametric first. The Pentametric has a relay that
can be configured to close when the SoC drops to a preset level, and open when it rises to an "off" setpoint,
while also triggering off high and low temperature compensated battery voltages. Triggering just off of battery
voltage as the Xantrex AGS does isn't desirable (as the battery voltage varies with load as well as SoC
of charge), and I'd ideally like a load based trigger rather than running the batteries down when the
generator will need to be started soon enough anyway, but a SoC based trigger would be preferable to what
I have now. The Pentametric monitor costs $360 (or $510 with the optional Ethernet interface).
<h3>Troubleshooting Notes</h3>
In fairness to Schneider/Xantrex the XW 6048 inverter and AGS module are complex devices and they have
been generally responsive in talking to me on the phone and via E-mail. Some of our troubleshooting sessions
have taken the better part of an hour and they're still talking to me. In the hope that we may yet succeed
in figuring out and correcting the false start problem I offer the following thoughts:
<ul>
<li> I will cheerfully configure any logging the Combox is capable of.
<li> I have a logging multimeter (Fluke 289) which can do detailed logging of any one parameter of
	interest (e.g. voltage, current) for periods of up to several days. Since the false starts don't happen
	every day it may take awhile to capture the data of interest, but then again since the AGS was installed
	about a month ago we've not experienced more than three days without a false start event.
<li> I can configure direct access to the Combox by Schneider/Xantrex personnel. I'll need the source IP address to
	forward inbound connections through the firewalls.
</ul>
What I don't want to do is keep "resetting to factory defaults". I've been asked to do that several times now.
The very detailed <a href="xantrex.txt">configuration</a> must be painstakingly typed in manually, a process
that takes about twenty minutes during which time the critical loads are without power. I can accept an occasional
mysterious glitch<small><sup>13</sup></small> in heavily computerized hardware, but such a "reboot" is a last resort
intervention that is not acceptable on a routine basis.

<p>
<sup>2</sup> In hindsight I consider an SCP next to the AGS to be essential to getting the Xantrex autostart
working, and the Conext Combox as well. Note that
starts to add up though; roughly $222 for the second SCP, $365 for the Combox, plus the $170 for the AGS makes
nearly $800 in Xantrex autostart-related hardware alone. Ouch.
<p>
<sup>3</sup> I'm assuming that the battery voltage must drop below the 54.3V float voltage level for the inverter
to operate.
<p>
<sup>4</sup> Less than five seconds per the Combox log, but almost certainly zero per the earlier discussion of
the Trimetric State-of-Charge monitor. I was not present on 8-27 to confirm that no very brief grid interruption
occurred but I have witnessed multiple similar false starts where there was no perceptible drop in battery voltage
(below float charging level).
<p>
<sup>5</sup> With the possible exception of an instance where a nuisance alarm (low battery warning) sounding
when it shouldn't.
<p>
<sup>6</sup> Terminate one end of a Cat5 cable per T568A and the other per T568B and you have a crossover cable.
<p>
<sup>7</sup> I've found several discussions online that claim that the rebranding of the Xantrex XW6048 to the
Conext XW+6848 involved only software and cosmetic changes, and not any substantive hardware upgrades. According
to those discussions the new rating of 6800W versus 6000W just reflects the use of new criteria for that rating.
<p>
<sup>8</sup> Professional electricians laugh at me when I do that, but I'm comfortable with the use of torque
wrenches where proper torque does matter (I own a dozen torque wrenches), and I want to "CYA" to deflect any
possible warranty issues.
<p>
<sup>9</sup> The transfer switch selects between two generators, a manual start gasoline genset and the autostart
diesel generator. Normally the switch is set to the diesel generator, but will be switched to the gasoline one
when exercising that generator with a load. The run-inhibit switch prevents autostart of the diesel generator
when its output isn't visible to the XW inverter. It also constitutes another visible and easily understood
means to disable autostart; just grab the transfer switch handle and pull it outwards slightly. I've wired a
bright red indicator LED to show when this run-inhibit is in effect.
<p>
<sup>10</sup> The time delay relay is currently superfluous with the Pentametric meter controlling the generator,
as the Pentametric has shown no tendency for false starts. The TD relay was ordered before the Pentametric. It
still comes in handy for testing because the built-in LEDs will show coil activation before the contacts close,
allowing testing without an actual generator start without disconnecting any wiring.
<p>
<sup>11</sup> I date myself with the use of ASCII art, which I use for this sort of thing out of old habit. In
the event of a catastrophic failure of the local infrastructure one can read or edit ASCII files on any type
of computer, so I tend to keep key elements of mission critical info in plain text format.
<p>
<sup>12</sup> In principle the Xantrex AGS could have autostarted the generator directly, without the Inova
board. However, that would have required running a harness of multiple wires out to the generator, and non-trivial
custom wiring within the generator. The Xantrax AGS is also significantly less sophisticated than the Invoa board,
which directly recognizes fault conditions such as low oil pressure and overtemp or overload conditions,
and does a temperature compensated preheat interval.
<p>
<sup>13</sup> In the year and a half of operation before the AGS was added I only did such a reset once, and that
was at the request of Xantrex technical support for a nuisance alarm. That alarm has not occurred since but I
don't know if the reset had anything to do with it.
