<p>Yes, I contracted a severe case of “metal ilness” a few years ago. It might be contagious, my brother has been afflicted for many years and I have two uncles who spent their entire careers as master machinists and tool and die makers. I started with a small Chinese lathe but quickly discovered the overwhelming appeal of “old iron” when I was looking to upgrade my tiny little benchtop drill press with a free-standing model.  On a whim I bought a 30+ year old “jig borer”, figuring that for about 25¢ a pound I couldn’t go too wrong and that it would make one heck of a drill press even if badly worn.</p>
<p>Well, it cleaned up very nicely and that “drill press on steroids” ruined me for ever being satisfied with lesser machines.  Now my 760 sq-ft workshop is jammed full of some 15,000 pounds of machinery.  If only I had more time to play there in the “man cave”.</p>
